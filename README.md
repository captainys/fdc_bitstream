# C++ FDC library to manipulate 2D/MFM bitstream image data

Work in progress.

## Description:  
This is a C++ library to provide FDC functions. 
Read and write functions mimic the actual operation of the Western Digital FD179x or Fujitsu MB8876 FDCs.
The FDC library is designed to be integrated with the old PC emulator programs.  

This FDC library can handle raw FDD output read data before the C/D separation is applied.  
The FDC library includes a data separator and simple PLL(DLL) emulation features thus, the FDC can reproduce some copy protection data, which requires precise sub-bitrate data pulse timing.  

### Supported functions:
- Track read
- Track write
- ID read
- Sector read
- Sector write

### Supported floppy disk image formats:  
You can use `*.HFE` (for HxC floppy emulator), `*.MFM` (my original disk format), and `*.RAW` (which can be generated by [floppy_disk_shield_2d](https://github.com/yas-sim/floppy_disk_shield_2d)). The specification of the `MFM` and `RAW` formats was defined by me. That format can preserve precise sub-bitrate pulse data. By default, these file formats will capture the FDD RD data at the sampling rate of 4MHz.  

## API Document  
The API document generated by Doxygen can be found at `./docs/html directory.`  Please open [`./docs/html/index.html`](./docs/html/index.html) with a browser.   
*Note:* You can't open the HTML document from GitHub. Please clone the project and open the document locally.  

### MFM image data format:
The default sampling rate for the MFM format is 4MHz. The data rate of an orginary 2D/MFM format data is 500KHz. This means, one bit cell will be recorded with eight bits of data in the MFM format.  

`|00001000|00000000|00100000|00010000|00000000| => 0x08,0x00,0x20,0x10,0x00 in MFM format`

```C++
// Header (ofst(byte) = 0)
typedef struct mfm_header_ {
    uint8_t     id_str[8];                  //  "MFM_IMG "
    uint64_t    track_table_offset;         // 
    uint64_t    number_of_tracks;           //
    uint64_t    spindle_time_ns;            //  Time for 1 rotation (ns unit) 
    uint64_t    data_bit_rate;              //  Data bit rate (bit/sec)    MFM=500Kbit/sec = 500,000
    uint64_t    sampling_rate;              //  Sampling rate of the bit stream data     4MHz = 4,000,000
} mfm_header;

// Track offset table (ofst(byte) = header.track_table_offset)
typedef struct track_table_ {
    uint64_t    offset;                     // Offset to the track data (unit=byte, from the top of the file == absolute offset)
    uint64_t    length_bit;                 // Track data length (uint=bits, not bytes)
} mfm_track_table;

// Track data * 84
//   ofst(byte) = track_table[track#].offset
//   size(byte) = track_table[track#].length_bit/8 + (track_table[track#].length%8)?1:0)
```
