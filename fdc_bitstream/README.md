# The C++ FDC bitstream library  

## Description:  
This is a C++ library to provide FDC functions. 
Read and write functions mimic the actual operation of the Western Digital FD179x or Fujitsu MB8876 FDCs.
The FDC library is designed to be integrated with the old PC emulator programs.  

This FDC library can handle raw FDD output read data before the C/D separation is applied.  
The FDC library includes a data separator and simple VFO emulation features thus, the FDC can reproduce some copy protection data, which requires precise sub-bitrate data pulse timing.  

**This library directly reads and writes the bit stream data, so the track bit stream data even after applying some write operations, is still compliant with actual floppy bit stream data.**  

### Supported functions:
- Track read
- Track write
- ID read
- Sector read
- Sector write

### Supported floppy disk image formats:  
You can use `*.HFE` (for HxC floppy emulator), `*.MFM` (my original disk format), `*.RAW` (which can be generated by [floppy_disk_shield_2d](https://github.com/yas-sim/floppy_disk_shield_2d)), and `*.D77` (or D88. Originally, developed for a PC-8801 emulator). The specification of the `MFM` and `RAW` formats was defined by myself. These format can preserve precise sub-bitrate pulse data. By default, these file formats will capture the FDD RD data at the sampling rate of 4MHz.

## How to integrate the fdc_bitstream library with your program
1. Required files  
	- Source codes: All C++ source codes are stored in the `./fdc_bitstream` and `./fdc_common` directories. `fdc_bitstream` depends on `fdc_common`. 
	- Header files: All C++ header files are stored in the `./includes` directory.
2. Classes
- Use the `fdc_bitstream` object to access the track data.  
	- `fdc_bitstream` takes track data in a `bit_array` object and performs read and write operations.  
	 -`fdc_bitstream` doesn't provide *seek* and *restore* functions. It simply provides read and write functions for the track data provided. The user program must handle *seek* and *restore* equivalent operations.  
- Track data is held in the `bit_array` object.  
	- You can access the data with *bit address* with `bit_array` object.  
	- `bit_array` object has an internal access pointer and provides streaming access. You can read and write bit data sequentially with the streaming functions.   
 	- You can choose two modes when you access by the streaming functions. One is ring-buffer mode, and the other one is elastic buffer mode.  
 	- In ring-buffer mode, you can access the bit data with the auto-increment pointer, and the pointer will go back to the top when it reaches the end of the buffer.    
 	- In elastic buffer mode, the buffer will automatically extend as you write over the end of the buffer.  
 - Use one of the `disk_image_???` class to read the disk image file. Supported formats are `HFE`, `MFM`, `RAW`, and `D77` (`MFM` and `RAW` are my original format. It is not compatible any other existing disk formats which shares the same file extension).
